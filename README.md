Excited to share the results of my recent data analysis project in Excel! ðŸš€
At Archie's Store, we aimed to unlock valuable insights from our 2022 sales data to drive growth in 2023. Here's a glimpse of what we accomplished:

Objective: To create a comprehensive annual sales report, understand customer behavior, and supercharge our sales strategies for 2023.

Key Findings:
$ Women dominate our customer base, accounting for 65% of all purchases.
$  Top-performing states: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh (35% of total sales).
$  Target audience: Women aged 30-49 in these states for strategic marketing efforts.
$  Primary sales channels: Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra (80% of total sales).

Tasks During My Project:
 Data Cleaning: The foundation of any successful analysis. I  cleaned and organized the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. One noteworthy task involved replacing 'M' with 'Men' and 'W' with 'Women' in the gender column. I also converted worded numbers into numeric form in the Quantity (Qty) column, ensuring uniformity for analysis.

 Data Processing: To make our data more insightful, I created a new column called "Age Group" by categorizing the population based on their age. This included segments like seniors (50 and over), adults (30 to 49), youth (20 to 29), and teenagers (13 to 19), using a formula. Additionally, I created a "Month" column to extract the month's name from the date, enabling a deeper analysis of monthly trends.

 Data Analysis:   This was where the real magic happened. I developed interactive dashboards and pivot charts to address specific store requirements, such as:
Sales vs. Orders: Visualizing the correlation between sales and order volumes.
Sales by Gender: Providing insights into the gender-based purchasing trends in 2022.
Order Status: Listing the different order statuses in 2022 for better order management.
Top 5 States by Sales: Identifying the geographical areas contributing most to our revenue.
Age vs. Gender in Orders: Exploring the relationship between age and gender based on the number of orders.
Shopping Channels: Determining which channel contributed the most to our sales.
Highest-selling Category: Identifying the product category driving our sales.
